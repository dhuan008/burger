# burger

A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).

## Demo

I decided to take my card info off of heroku so no hosted demo.

## Installation

You can run the application locally by cloning this repository
	
Then, install dependancies using npm or yarn

	npm install
    yarn add
	
Then start the server by running

	npm run start
    yarn start
	
Now you can test out the application at: `http://localhost:8081/`.
